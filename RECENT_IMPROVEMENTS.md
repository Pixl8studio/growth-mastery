# What's New in GrowthMastery.ai

*Updates from the past few days*

## Talk to Your Funnel with Voice Input

You can now **speak instead of type** throughout the entire business profile wizard. Just click the microphone button and start talking — your words will be automatically converted to text. This makes it much faster and easier to describe your business, especially when you have a lot to say.

---

## See Your Business Profile at a Glance

We added a new **Business Profile Summary Card** that shows you everything you've entered about your business in one place. Each section is clickable — just tap on any area you want to update, and an easy-to-use editing window opens up.

---

## Your Work Saves Automatically

No more worrying about losing your progress. Everything you enter now **saves automatically** as you go. You'll see a small indicator letting you know when your changes are being saved and when they're complete.

---

## Simpler, Clearer Wizard Experience

We streamlined the business profile wizard to be more straightforward:

- **One clear starting point** — just click "Begin" to start entering your information
- **Removed confusing options** — no more choosing between different methods
- **Cleaner screens** — we removed outdated sections that were no longer needed

## Better Presentation Creation

We fixed several issues to make creating your presentation slides more reliable:

- **All your slides now appear correctly** — previously, some slides could get cut off
- **Clearer progress updates** — you'll see exactly what's happening while your presentation is being created
- **Helpful error messages** — if something goes wrong, you'll understand why and what to do next

---

## Improved Talk Track Generation

Creating speaker notes for your presentation is now more reliable:

- **Better progress tracking** — see exactly where you are in the process
- **Smoother experience** — fixed issues that could cause the process to stall silently
- **Clearer notifications** — success and error messages are now easier to distinguish

---

## Cleaner Interface Throughout

We polished up the interface to feel more professional:
