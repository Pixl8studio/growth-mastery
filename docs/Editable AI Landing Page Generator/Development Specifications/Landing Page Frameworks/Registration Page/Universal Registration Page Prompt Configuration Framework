```

py-32 px-4                    /* Emphasis section */

/* Container */
container mx-auto max-w-6xl   /* Wide content */
container mx-auto max-w-4xl   /* Focused content */
container mx-auto max-w-2xl   /* Form content */

/* Element Gaps */
space-y-8                     /* Section internal */
gap-8                         /* Grid items */
mb-16                         /* Section headings */
```

### Visual Effects

                hover:-translate-y-2 border-border/50">
```

**Buttons (Primary CTA):**

                   transition-all duration-300 text-lg px-8 py-6

## Copy Writing Principles

### Headlines
- **Outcome + Timeframe:** Always lead with the transformation and speed
- **Gradient Text:** Apply to the most desirable part of the headline
- **Non-Breaking Spaces:** Use `&nbsp;` to prevent awkward line breaks

### Body Copy
- **Conversational Tone:** Write like talking to a friend
- **Short Paragraphs:** 1-3 sentences maximum
- **Leading Relaxed:** Use `leading-relaxed` for readability
- **Muted for Secondary:** Use `text-muted-foreground` for supporting text

### CTAs
- **Action Verbs:** Start with verbs (Watch, Get, Join, Save, Start)
- **Benefit-Focused:** Imply the result (Get Access vs. Submit)
- **Urgency Words:** Use sparingly and authentically

### Social Proof
- **Specific Numbers:** "100+ founders" not "many people"
- **Role Relevance:** Match testimonial roles to target audience
- **Outcome-Focused:** Testimonials should mention specific results

---

## Conversion Optimization Patterns

### Above the Fold
- Hero captures 100vh minimum height
- Clear value proposition visible immediately
- Primary CTA accessible without scrolling

### Form Placement
- Registration form appears early (section 2)
- Repeated CTA buttons throughout page
- Mobile sticky CTA ensures constant access

### Trust Building Sequence
```
1. Promise (Hero) → 2. Value Preview (Modules) → 
3. Self-Selection (Qualification) → 4. Social Proof (Testimonials) → 
5. Authority (Instructor) → 6. Final Push (CTA)
```

### Objection Handling
| Objection | Section |
|-----------|---------|
| "Not for my industry" | Business Types Section |
| "Is this for me?" | Qualification Section |
| "Who is teaching this?" | Instructor Section |
| "What will I learn?" | Learning Modules Section |
| "What's the system?" | Transformation Section |
