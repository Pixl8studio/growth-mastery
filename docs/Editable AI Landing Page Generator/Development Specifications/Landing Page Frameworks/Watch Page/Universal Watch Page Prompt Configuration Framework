# 1. PAGE ARCHITECTURE

## Section Sequence (Top to Bottom)

| Order | Section | Component | Strategic Purpose | Psychological Logic |
|-------|---------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Header/Navigation** | `WatchHeader.tsx` | Brand recognition, navigation context | Establishes trust and professional credibility |
| 2 | **Video Hero** | `VideoHero.tsx` | Capture attention, deliver core content | Immediate value delivery - "I'm in the right place" |
| 3 | **Video Player** | `VideoPlayer.tsx` | Primary content delivery mechanism | The core value exchange - education + transformation preview |
| 4 | **CTA Strip** | `CTAStrip.tsx` | Conversion opportunity post-video | Strike while engaged - highest intent moment |
| 5 | **Presenter Bio** | `PresenterBio.tsx` | Build authority and trust | "Who is teaching me?" - credibility establishment |
| 6 | **Secondary CTA** | `SecondaryCTA.tsx` | Reinforced conversion opportunity | Multiple touchpoints increase conversion probability |
| 7 | **Footer** | `Footer.tsx` | Legal, contact, brand consistency | Professional closure and support access |

## Conversion Flow Psychology

```
ATTENTION → ENGAGEMENT → EDUCATION → CONVICTION → ACTION
    │            │            │            │          │
    ▼            ▼            ▼            ▼          ▼
  Headline    Video      Content      Presenter    CTA
  + Promise   Player     Delivery     Authority    Buttons
```

### Key Psychological Principles:

1. **Immediate Engagement** (Video Hero) - Video as focal point captures and holds attention
2. **Value-First** (Content) - Education before ask builds reciprocity
3. **Authority Building** (Presenter) - Credibility reduces skepticism
4. **Strategic Placement** (CTAs) - Multiple conversion points at high-intent moments
5. **Minimal Distraction** - Clean design keeps focus on video and action
6. **Urgency Elements** - Limited replay access creates action pressure

# 2. SECTION-BY-SECTION COPY FRAMEWORK

---

## 2.1 HEADER/NAVIGATION SECTION

### Structure
```
[LOGO] (Left-aligned)
[NAVIGATION] (Right-aligned, minimal)
  - "About" (optional)
  - CTA Button (primary action)
```

### Logo Placement
- Left-aligned for brand recognition
- Subtle, doesn't compete with video

### CTA Button (Header)
```
[ACTION_VERB] [OFFER_NAME]
```
**Examples:**
- "Enroll Now"
- "Get Access"
- "Join the Program"

---

## 2.2 VIDEO HERO SECTION

### Purpose
The central focus of the entire page. The video hero contains the headline, subheadline, and the video player itself.

### Headline Formula
```
[TOPIC/TRANSFORMATION] **[BOLD_KEYWORD]**
```

**Format:** Title case with strategic bold emphasis on key transformation word.

**Variables:**
- `{TOPIC}`: The subject matter (e.g., "Growth Automation", "Sales System", "Marketing")
- `{BOLD_KEYWORD}`: The aspirational word to emphasize (e.g., "Masterclass", "Blueprint", "System")

**Examples:**
- "Growth Automation **Masterclass**"
- "6-Figure Funnel **Blueprint**"
- "Automated Sales **System**"

### Subheadline Formula
```
**Discover the [NUMBER]-step [SYSTEM/METHOD] to [TRANSFORMATION_1] With a [DESIRABLE_OUTCOME] that [BENEFIT] while you [EFFORTLESS_STATE].**
```

**Variables:**
- `{NUMBER}`: Specific step count (3, 5, 7 - odd numbers convert better)
- `{SYSTEM/METHOD}`: What they're learning (System, Framework, Method, Process)
- `{TRANSFORMATION_1}`: Primary transformation (Scale Your Genius, Grow Your Business)
- `{DESIRABLE_OUTCOME}`: The tangible deliverable (6-figure funnel, automated system)
- `{BENEFIT}`: What it does (sells, converts, generates leads)
- `{EFFORTLESS_STATE}`: Passive benefit (while you sleep, without you)

**Examples:**
- "Discover the 3-step System to Scale Your Genius With a 6-figure Automated Masterclass Funnel that sells while you sleep."
- "Learn the 5-step Framework to Build Your Empire With an Automated Sales System that converts 24/7."

### CTA Button Formula (Below Video)

[ACTION_VERB] In [OFFER_NAME]
```
**Examples:**

# 3. DESIGN SYSTEM PRINCIPLES

---

## 3.1 Color Architecture (HSL)

### Watch Page Specific Considerations
Watch pages typically use darker/neutral backgrounds around the video area to:
- Reduce eye strain during video viewing
- Create cinema-like focus on content
- Make the video player the hero element

### Primary Palette
| Token | HSL Value | Usage |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `--primary` | `103 89% 29%` | CTAs, accent elements, links |
| `--primary-foreground` | `48 38% 97%` | Text on primary buttons |
| `--secondary` | `152 88% 15%` | Video area background, dark sections |
| `--accent` | `45 93% 58%` | Highlights, urgency indicators |

### Video Section Palette
| Token | HSL Value | Usage |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `--video-bg` | `0 0% 8%` | Video player background (near black) |
| `--video-controls` | `0 0% 100%` | Video control icons |
| `--video-progress` | `103 89% 29%` | Progress bar fill (primary) |
| `--video-buffer` | `0 0% 30%` | Buffer indicator |

### Neutral Palette
| Token | HSL Value | Usage |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| `--background` | `48 38% 97%` | Page background (light) |
| `--background-dark` | `0 0% 12%` | Video section background |
| `--foreground` | `0 0% 12%` | Primary text on light |
| `--foreground-light` | `0 0% 95%` | Primary text on dark |
| `--muted` | `0 0% 45%` | Secondary text |

---

## 3.2 Gradients

```css
--gradient-cta: linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(103 89% 29%) 0%, hsl(120 55% 55%) 100%);
--gradient-dark: linear-gradient(180deg, hsl(0 0% 8%) 0%, hsl(0 0% 15%) 100%);
--gradient-hero: linear-gradient(180deg, hsl(48 38% 97%) 0%, hsl(145 40% 95%) 100%);
```

---

## 3.3 Typography Scale

### Watch Page Specific
Watch pages prioritize readability and minimal distraction.

```css
/* Headlines */
H1 (Video Title): text-4xl md:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-display font-bold

--font-display: "Poppins", "Inter", sans-serif;
```

---

## 3.4 Spacing System

### Section Padding

py-16 md:py-24   /* Standard sections (presenter bio) */
py-4 md:py-8     /* Video wrapper padding */
```

### Container
```css
container mx-auto px-4 md:px-6
max-w-4xl   /* Video section content */

```

---

## 3.6 Border Radius

---

## 3.7 Animations

### Watch Page Specific Animations
```css
@keyframes fade-in {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(10px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}

@keyframes pulse-cta {
  0%, 100% { transform: scale(1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.02); }
}

@keyframes glow {
  0%, 100% { box-shadow: 0 0 20px hsl(103 89% 29% / 0.3); }
  50% { box-shadow: 0 0 40px hsl(103 89% 29% / 0.5); }
}
```

    <!-- Video embed here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

### CTA Button Pattern
```html
<a href="#enroll" class="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-8 py-4 
                         rounded-xl gradient-cta text-white 
                         font-semibold text-lg shadow-cta 
                         hover:scale-105 transition-all">
  Enroll In [Offer Name]
  <svg class="w-5 h-5"><!-- Arrow icon --></svg>
</a>
```

### Presenter Card Pattern

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-display font-bold">[Name]</h3>
    <p class="text-muted-foreground">[Title]</p>
    <div class="prose prose-lg">[Bio paragraphs]</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

---

## 3.9 Background Patterns

<section class="bg-gradient-to-b from-gray-900 to-gray-950 py-8">
  <!-- Dark, cinematic feel for video focus -->
</section>
```

### Content Section Background
```html
<section class="bg-background py-16">
  <!-- Light, clean background for readability -->
</section>
```

# 4. COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES

---

## 4.1 Headline Rules

### Watch Page Headlines
- **Concise:** 2-4 words maximum for main headline
- **Bold Emphasis:** Use `**bold**` or gradient text on key transformation word
- **Topic + Format:** "[Topic] **[Format]**" (e.g., "Growth Automation **Masterclass**")

### Subheadline Rules
- **Promise Structure:** Always include transformation promise
- **Specificity:** Include numbers (3-step, 6-figure, etc.)
- **Outcome + Benefit:** What they get AND what it does for them
- **Effortless Frame:** End with passive benefit ("while you sleep", "automatically")

---

## 4.2 Body Copy Voice

### Tone for Watch Pages
- **Direct:** Get to the value quickly
- **Confident:** The content speaks for itself
- **Aspirational:** Focus on transformation potential
- **Minimal:** Less copy, more video

### Bio Copy Voice
- **Third Person:** "Joe has helped..." not "I have helped..."
- **Achievement-Focused:** Lead with results, not effort
- **Relatable:** Include human elements (origin story)
- **Mission-Aligned:** Connect personal journey to bigger purpose

---

## 4.3 CTA Optimization

### Primary CTA Formula
```
[ENROLLMENT_VERB] [IN/THE] [OFFER_NAME]
```
- "Enroll In Genius Launch System"
- "Join The Accelerator Program"
- "Get The Complete System"

### CTA Button Best Practices
- Action-oriented verbs (Enroll, Join, Get, Start)
- Include offer name for clarity
- High contrast colors
- Arrow icon for directional cue
- Hover animations for engagement

---

## 4.4 Urgency Elements (Use Sparingly)

### Authentic Urgency Patterns
```
- "Replay available for [TIMEFRAME]"
- "Special pricing ends [DATE]"
- "Limited enrollment period"
```

### Avoid
- Fake scarcity
- Countdown timers on evergreen content
- Pressure tactics that erode trust

---

# 5. CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION PATTERNS

---

## 5.1 Video-First Layout

### Above the Fold Must Include:
1. **Headline** - Clear topic identification
2. **Subheadline** - Value proposition
3. **Video Player** - At least top portion visible
4. **CTA** - Visible without scrolling (sticky or positioned)

### Video Placement Priority
```
              ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
              │         HEADLINE                │
              │       Subheadline               │
              ├─────────────────────────────────┤
              │                                 │
              │      [VIDEO PLAYER]             │
              │                                 │
              ├─────────────────────────────────┤
              │      [CTA BUTTON]               │
              └─────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

## 5.2 CTA Placement Strategy

### Multiple Conversion Points
| Location | Purpose | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Header | Immediate access for return visitors | Secondary |
| Below Video | Highest intent - just watched content | Primary |
| After Bio | Authority convinced, ready to act | Secondary |
| Floating/Sticky | Always accessible | Optional |

---

## 5.3 Trust Building Sequence

```
1. Brand Recognition (Logo/Header) → 
2. Value Delivery (Video Content) → 
3. Authority (Presenter Bio) → 
4. Action (CTA)
```

---

## 5.4 Minimal Distraction Design

### Remove/Minimize:
- Complex navigation
- Sidebars
- Related content links
- Social share buttons (in main flow)
- Comment sections (if not moderated)

### Keep Focus On:
- Video player
- CTA buttons
- Essential trust elements
