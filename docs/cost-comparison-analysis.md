## The Hidden Costs You're Also Avoiding

### 1. Time Cost
- **Coordinator time**: 10-20 hours/week managing vendors
- **Communication overhead**: Endless email threads, Slack messages, Zoom calls

- **Momentum loss**: Energy spent managing vendors instead of growing

### 3. Risk Cost
- **Quality inconsistency**: Different vendors = different standards
- **Integration failures**: Tools that don't talk to each other
- **Vendor dependency**: What happens when your copywriter ghosts you?
- **Knowledge silos**: Information spread across multiple people

### 4. Iteration Cost
- **Changing one thing**: Requires re-engaging multiple vendors
- **A/B testing**: Additional cost for every variant
- **Optimization**: Continuous expense to improve performance

## ROI Calculator

### Break-Even Analysis

**If your first funnel generates just one sale**, what's that worth to your business?

| $2,500 | $25,000 | 10 sales |
| $5,000 | $25,000 | 5 sales |
| $10,000 | $25,000 | 2.5 sales |

**With Genie, your break-even is your subscription cost divided by your average sale price.**
