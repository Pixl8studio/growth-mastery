## Competitive Threats

### Short Term (Low)

- They're not focused on webinars specifically
- No AI generation on roadmap (publicly)
- Complexity works against them

### Medium Term (Medium)

- Could acquire or build AI features
- Massive user base to upsell
- Strong brand and community

### Long Term (Medium-High)

- Russell Brunson is smart, innovative
- Resources to execute if they prioritize
- First-mover advantage in funnel category

## How They Could Respond

### Most Likely

- Partner with AI copywriting tool (Jasper, Copy.ai)
- Add "AI assistant" as upsell feature
- Keep general-purpose positioning

### Less Likely

- Build webinar-specific AI generation (not their strategy)
- Acquire a competitor like us (possible but unlikely)

### If They Go AI-First

- Would validate our approach
- We'd still win on focus (webinars) vs. general-purpose
- Speed and simplicity advantage

## Monitoring

**Watch For**:

- AI feature announcements
- Webinar-specific template launches
- Pricing changes
- Major marketing pivots

## Key Takeaways

1. **Respect**: They created the category. Massive brand. Strong community.
2. **Opening**: AI generation + webinar focus = clear differentiation
3. **Not Direct Competition**: Different approach, different customer
4. **Learn From**: Marketing, community-building, education-first approach
5. **Don't Compete On**: General-purpose features, template quantity, ecosystem
