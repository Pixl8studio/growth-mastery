## Who Chooses WebinarJam Over Us

## Competitive Threats

### Short Term (Low)

- Focused on delivery, not creation
- No AI on roadmap (visible)
- Different customer need (live vs. automated)

### Medium Term (Low-Medium)

- Could add AI features
- Could build funnel creation
- But not their core competency

### Long Term (Low)

- Market moving to AI-generated content
- Live webinars are high-effort, doesn't scale
- Delivery-only platforms are commoditizing

## How They Could Respond

### Most Likely

- Add basic AI assistance (chat widget)
- Partner with copywriting AI tool
- Stay focused on delivery excellence

### Less Likely

- Build complete funnel creation suite
- Develop AI presentation generation
- Pivot to full funnel platform

### If They Go AI-First

- Would validate our approach
- Still differentiated (we're funnel-complete)
- They'd need to rebuild significant platform

## Market Dynamics

**The Shift**:

- Live webinars → Automated evergreen funnels
- Manual content → AI-generated content
- Delivery platforms → Complete systems
- Pay-upfront → Performance-based pricing

**WebinarJam's Challenge**:

- Built for previous era (live webinars)
- Delivery-only model being disrupted
- Need to evolve or become commodity

**Our Opportunity**:

- Right timing for AI-first approach
- Complete funnel vs. delivery-only
- Aligned pricing (we win when they win)

## Monitoring

**Watch For**:

- AI feature announcements
- Platform redesigns/modernization
- Pricing model changes
- Partnership announcements

**Sources**:

- Product updates blog
- User reviews (G2, Trustpilot)
- Facebook user groups
- Competitor feature tracking

## Key Takeaways

1. **Different Need**: They do delivery, we do creation + delivery
2. **Complementary**: Could integrate (use our content, their delivery)
3. **Low Threat**: Not positioned to pivot to AI creation
4. **Learn From**: Reliability at scale, registration flow UX
5. **Don't Compete On**: Live webinar infrastructure (not our focus)
