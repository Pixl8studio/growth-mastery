# GrowthMastery.ai - 2026 Strategic Plan

## Positioning for the 2035 Outcome Economy

_A strategic roadmap for transitioning from AI-powered funnel builder to decision
amplification platform_

---

## Executive Summary

The world is transitioning from an **Input Economy** (pay for hours worked) to an
**Outcome Economy** (pay for value created). By 2035, the primary human skill won't be
solving problems—it will be **choosing which problems to solve** and directing
intelligence toward desired outcomes.

GrowthMastery.ai is already positioned in this direction. We take a 15-minute
conversation about someone's expertise and generate an entire automated revenue system.
We don't just build pages—we translate **intention into reality**.

**2026 is the bridge year.** We must evolve from "AI tool for webinar funnels" to
"platform that helps experts direct intelligence toward their vision of impact."

This isn't a pivot—it's an acceleration. The same DNA that makes us valuable today makes
us essential tomorrow.

## Part 1: Understanding the Shift

### Where the World Is Going (2025-2035)

| Old Economy (Input)                     | New Economy (Outcome)                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Trade time for money                    | Trade purpose for reality                      |
| Value = hours worked                    | Value = outcomes created                       |
| Scarce resource = labor                 | Scarce resource = compute + direction          |
| Workers solve assigned problems         | Leaders choose which problems deserve solving  |
| Money measures what you can have        | Compute measures what you can create           |
| Compete on execution speed              | Compete on vision clarity + taste              |

### What This Means for GrowthMastery.ai

Today we say: _"We build webinar funnels using AI"_

By 2026 we must say: _"We help experts translate their vision into automated systems
that create impact while they sleep"_

The shift:

- From **features** → to **outcomes**
- From **customers** → to **community of purpose**
- From **tool** → to **decision amplification system**
- From **what can AI do?** → to **what should exist?**

---

## Part 2: Strategic Pillars for 2026

### Pillar 1: Outcome-First Product Design

**The Principle**: Don't ask "what features do users want?" Ask "what outcomes are they
trying to create?"

**Current State**: We help people build webinar funnels.

**2026 Evolution**: We help people answer:
- "How do I package my expertise for scale?"
- "What's the highest-leverage way to create impact?"
- "Given my strengths and market, what should exist?"

**Concrete Manifestations**:

1. **Vision Discovery Session** (Evolution of VAPI intake call)
   - Not just "describe your offer"
   - Deep exploration: "What impact do you want to create? Who needs this most? What
     does success look like in 3 years?"
   - AI synthesizes into strategic brief, not just content inputs

2. **Outcome Mapping Dashboard**
   - Show the journey from intention → funnel → revenue → impact
   - Visualize "If this converts at X%, you'll reach Y people and generate Z revenue"
   - Make the connection between daily metrics and long-term vision tangible

3. **Intelligence Allocation View**
   - Frame AI generation credits as "compute directed toward your vision"
   - Show users they're not paying for features—they're allocating resources toward
     outcomes
   - Begin acclimating users to compute-as-currency thinking

### Pillar 2: Community Over Customers

**The Principle**: In a UBS (Universal Basic Service) future, people don't buy to
survive—they gather to belong and build. Start building that now.

**Current State**: Traditional SaaS customer relationship.

**2026 Evolution**: A guild of experts who use GrowthMastery as their home base for
directing intelligence toward impact.

**Concrete Manifestations**:

1. **The Creators Guild**
   - Not a Facebook group—a purposeful community with shared mission
   - Mission: "Experts helping experts package wisdom for scale"
   - Members don't just use the tool—they contribute templates, share learnings,
     co-create best practices

2. **Peer Intelligence Network**
   - Enable creators to learn from each other's anonymized conversion data
   - "Coaches in your niche who used this framework saw 12% higher conversions"
   - Collective intelligence that benefits everyone

3. **Purpose Cohorts**
   - Quarterly programs where 10-20 creators work together to launch
   - Not courses—collaborative builds
   - Each cohort has a shared North Star beyond individual success

4. **Alumni as Ambassadors**
   - Those who succeed don't just refer—they mentor
   - Create paths for experienced creators to help newcomers
   - Build reputation/status that transcends the platform

### Pillar 3: From Funnels to Reality Design

**The Principle**: A funnel is just one expression of "turning intention into reality."
The muscle we're building applies far beyond webinars.

**Current State**: Webinar funnel builder.

**2026 Evolution**: Platform for expertise-based reality design.

**Concrete Manifestations**:

1. **Expanded "Reality Templates"**
   - Q1-Q2: Webinar funnels (current)
   - Q3: Challenge funnels (5-day transformation)
   - Q4: Membership launch sequences
   - 2027: Community-based programs, live experiences

   Each follows the same pattern: Intention → AI Generation → Automated Execution

2. **Multi-Modal Intelligence**
   - Beyond text/slides: Video script generation with teleprompter
   - Audio content: AI-generated podcast episodes from expertise
   - Community spaces: Auto-generated course structures
   - The platform becomes "director of intelligence across modalities"

3. **Outcome Tracking Across Touchpoints**
   - Not just "how did the funnel perform?"
   - "How is your entire ecosystem of automated systems performing?"
   - Single dashboard for all ways you're directing intelligence toward impact

### Pillar 4: Taste as the New Competitive Moat

**The Principle**: When everyone can generate content, the bottleneck becomes quality,
coherence, and alignment. We must be the platform where "taste" is built in.

**Current State**: AI generates professional-quality content.

**2026 Evolution**: AI generates content with discernment—knowing what should exist vs.
what merely could.

**Concrete Manifestations**:

1. **Opinionated Frameworks, Not Blank Canvases**
   - Continue our strength: 55-slide structure, proven patterns, conversion psychology
   - Double down: Every template embeds wisdom about what works
   - Users don't customize infinitely—they choose from carefully curated options

2. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Never compete on "unlimited generations"
   - Compete on "every generation is worth deploying"
   - Acceptance rate (% of generated content used without major edits) is our key
     quality metric

3. **Coherence Checks**
   - AI that reviews its own output: "Does this align with their stated vision?"
   - Flagging when something feels off before user sees it
   - The platform has taste, not just capability

4. **Regeneration Philosophy**
   - Position regeneration as "refining intention" not "AI got it wrong"
   - Each regeneration includes: "Here's what I understood. What should I emphasize
     differently?"
   - Training users to be better directors of intelligence

### Pillar 5: Preparing for Compute-as-Currency

**The Principle**: The wealthy person of 2035 isn't the one with the most ideas—it's the
one who knows which ideas deserve compute. Start building that muscle now.

**Current State**: Traditional subscription pricing.

**2026 Evolution**: Begin introducing compute/credit thinking alongside subscriptions.

**Concrete Manifestations**:

1. **Visible Intelligence Allocation**
   - Show "compute invested" in each project
   - "This funnel required 1.2M tokens of intelligence to create"
   - Not for billing—for awareness

2. **Monthly Intelligence Allowance**
   - Frame subscription as "intelligence allowance" not "software access"
   - "Your plan includes 5 complete funnel builds or 20 major regenerations"
   - Begin the mental shift toward directing resources, not consuming features

3. **Bonus Compute for Engagement**
   - Community contributions earn additional intelligence allocation
   - "Your template was used by 10 creators—you've earned 500K bonus tokens"
   - Value creation begets more creative capacity

4. **Compute Philanthropy**
   - Unused monthly allocation can be donated to emerging creators
   - "Pay it forward" culture
   - Preview of post-scarcity abundance dynamics

## Part 4: Business Model Evolution

### Current Model (2025)

- SaaS subscription ($X/month)
- 2.5% platform fee on transactions via Stripe Connect
- Traditional customer relationship

### 2026 Transition Model

**Layer 1: Access** (Subscription)
- Access to platform, basic intelligence allowance
- Entry to Creators Guild community
- Standard support

**Layer 2: Intelligence** (Compute-Framing)
- Position subscription as "monthly intelligence allocation"
- Visible compute investment in each project
- Begin building compute-as-currency mental model

**Layer 3: Community** (Value Beyond Tool)
- Guild membership with purpose-driven cohorts
- Peer learning and template sharing
- Reputation building for contributors

**Layer 4: Outcomes** (Success-Based Revenue)
- Continue 2.5% platform fee
- Explore additional outcome-based pricing (% of revenue enabled)
- Align our success completely with creator success

### 2027+ Vision Model

As we approach the Outcome Economy:

- **Intelligence Allowance**: Primary framing for subscription
- **Community Contribution Credits**: Earn compute through value creation
- **Outcome Participation**: Revenue share on enabled success
- **Compute Philanthropy**: Redistribution of unused capacity

The goal: When UBS becomes reality, we're already operating with abundance dynamics.

## Part 5: What We Are NOT Doing in 2026

**Explicit No's** (protect focus):

1. **Not competing on price or infinite features**
   - We're premium, opinionated, outcome-focused
   - Race to bottom is for commodity tools

2. **Not building general-purpose anything**
   - Every feature serves expertise-based impact creation
   - "Can we use this for X?" → "Only if X is expert → automated impact"

3. **Not chasing enterprise/team features**
   - Solo creators and small teams first
   - Agency tier only if validated demand

4. **Not international expansion**
   - English-speaking markets only
   - Focus beats breadth at this stage

5. **Not building our own AI models**
   - We're orchestrators, not foundation model builders
   - Our value is in direction, taste, and frameworks

6. **Not becoming a content marketplace**
   - Community sharing yes, transactional marketplace no
   - We're not Envato; we're a guild

---

## Part 6: Metrics That Matter

### Outcome Metrics (Primary)

1. **Creator Success Rate**
   - % of users who generate meaningful revenue through platform
   - Target: 30% of active users generating $1K+ monthly

2. **Impact Reach**
   - Total people reached through all GrowthMastery-enabled systems
   - Aggregate of all registrations, enrollments, engagements
   - Target: 1M people reached through creator funnels in 2026

3. **Time to Impact**
   - Duration from signup to first revenue-generating funnel
   - Target: 7 days median

### Community Metrics (Secondary)

4. **Guild Engagement**
   - Monthly active participation in community
   - Template contributions
   - Peer support interactions

5. **Cohort Success**
   - Retention and outcomes for cohort participants vs. solo users
   - Referrals from community members

6. **Reputation Building**
   - Users developing recognized expertise through platform
   - External speaking, content, recognition enabled by success

### Quality Metrics (Tertiary)

7. **AI Acceptance Rate**
   - % of generated content used without major edits
   - Target: 85%+ (indicates taste and alignment)

8. **Regeneration Intent**
   - Why users regenerate: "refining vision" vs. "AI got it wrong"
   - Target: 70% refinement, 30% correction

9. **Coherence Score**
   - New metric: Does generated content align with stated vision?
   - AI self-evaluation + user feedback

---

## Part 7: The North Star

### Our 2035 Position

When ASI and humanoid robotics have industrialized most labor, GrowthMastery.ai is:

**The platform where experts direct intelligence toward human flourishing.**

We're not a tool. We're a home base for:
- People who know what should exist
- Communities that build meaning together
- Intelligence allocation toward impact that matters

The "floor" of what anyone can create rises. We help raise the ceiling for those with
clarity of purpose.

### Our 2026 Question

Each decision, feature, and initiative should answer:

> "Does this help creators direct intelligence toward outcomes that matter?"

If yes: proceed. If no: reconsider.

---

## Part 8: Implementation Notes

### How to Use This Strategy

1. **For Product Decisions**
   - Reference Pillars 1-5 when prioritizing features
   - Ask: "Does this move us toward outcome thinking?"
   - Check against quarterly initiatives

2. **For Marketing/Positioning**
   - Gradually shift language toward outcomes and intelligence direction
   - Don't abruptly change—evolve naturally
   - Test new framing with community before broad rollout

3. **For Community Building**
   - Start small with purpose cohorts
   - Build intentionally, not for scale
   - Quality of connection over quantity of members

4. **For Team Alignment**
   - Share this vision with anyone involved
   - Make 2035 destination tangible
   - Connect daily work to long-term trajectory

### Review Cadence

- **Monthly**: Progress against quarterly initiatives
- **Quarterly**: Full pillar review, adjust tactics
- **Semi-annually**: Strategic review, assess distance to 2035 vision
- **Annually**: Complete strategy refresh

## Closing Reflection

The transition from Input Economy to Outcome Economy isn't something that happens to us.
It's something we're actively shaping.

GrowthMastery.ai has always been about helping experts create impact beyond their
direct time. We didn't build a page builder—we built a translator between human
intention and automated reality.

2026 is the year we make that explicit. We shift from "AI tool for funnels" to
"platform for directing intelligence toward impact." We build community over customer
base. We prepare our users—and ourselves—for a world where the question isn't "how do I
survive?" but "what will I create when I finally have the power to do anything?"

We are not preparing to survive the transition.

We are preparing to host it.
