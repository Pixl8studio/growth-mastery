- Custom development requirements
- **Why not**: Too opinionated, not enterprise-flexible enough

### The Affiliate Marketer

- Promoting other people's products
- High-volume low-quality traffic strategies

## Persona Usage Guidelines

### For Product Decisions

When evaluating features, ask: "Does Sarah need this to launch successfully?"

If it's only relevant to Lisa (agency), it's Phase 2 or 3.

### For Marketing

Sarah's language: "Turn your expertise into automated revenue" Marcus's language:
"Evergreen webinar funnels that convert like your live launches" Lisa's language:
"Deliver client funnels in days, not weeks"

### For Support

Sarah needs: Hand-holding, clear tutorials, "how to" guidance Marcus needs: Integration
docs, technical specs, API access Lisa needs: Bulk operations, client management,
reporting
