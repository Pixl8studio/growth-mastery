# Growth Mastery - Product Vision

## What Is This?

Growth Mastery is an AI-powered webinar funnel builder that transforms expertise into
automated sales systems. Creators go from initial consultation call to complete,
published webinar funnel - all generated by AI and ready to convert.

## The Problem We Solve

**The Pain**: Expert coaches, consultants, and course creators know their stuff but
struggle to package it into high-converting webinar funnels. Traditional approaches
require:

- Weeks of manual work creating slides, scripts, and sales copy
- Hiring expensive copywriters ($3k-$10k)
- Technical skills to build registration pages, video hosting, payment processing
- CRM integration expertise for follow-up automation
- Trial-and-error to find what converts

**Result**: Most experts never launch their webinar, or launch something mediocre that
doesn't convert.

## Our Solution

Growth Mastery uses AI to generate the entire funnel from a single intake conversation:

**Input**: 15-minute AI voice call where creator describes their offer, audience, and
approach

**Output**: Complete webinar funnel with:

- 55-slide presentation deck (Gamma-powered, 20 themes)
- Professional talk track/script
- Watch page with video player and CTA
- Registration page optimized for conversions
- Enrollment/sales page with all the elements
- AI-powered follow-up sequence (5 segments, personalized)
- Contact management with webhook delivery to their CRM
- Analytics tracking across the entire funnel

**Timeline**: Hours instead of weeks. Quality that rivals $10k+ custom builds.

## Why This Needs to Exist

### What's Broken Today

1. **ClickFunnels/Kartra**: Page builders without intelligence. You still write
   everything.
2. **WebinarJam/EverWebinar**: Video delivery without funnel creation. BYOC (bring your
   own content).
3. **Copywriting services**: Expensive, slow, hit-or-miss quality.
4. **DIY approach**: Overwhelming for non-technical creators. Most abandon it.

### What We Do Differently

**AI-First Design**: We don't just host your content - we generate it from your
expertise.

**Complete System**: Not just pages. Not just slides. The entire funnel in one platform.

**Platform Revenue Model**: Built on Stripe Connect, so we grow when our creators
succeed (2.5% platform fee on their sales).

**Smart Follow-Up**: 5-segment behavioral ladder with AI-personalized sequences, not
generic drip campaigns.

## Why We'll Win

### 1. **Time to Value**

- Traditional: 4-8 weeks from idea to launch
- Us: Same day - intake call to published funnel in hours

### 2. **Quality at Scale**

- AI generation trained on proven frameworks (Magnetic Masterclass, VSL patterns)
- 55-slide deck structure based on what converts
- Professional copy without hiring copywriters

### 3. **Complete Integration**

- Funnel builder + presentation + CRM + analytics + follow-up
- Competitors make you stitch together 5+ tools
- We're the single source of truth

### 4. **Aligned Economics**

- Stripe Connect: We only win when they win (2.5% platform fee)
- Not subscription-trapped - incentivized to help them succeed
- Transparent pricing model

### 5. **Technical Excellence**

- Modern stack (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Real-time analytics and engagement tracking
- Robust webhook system for CRM integration
- Enterprise-grade logging and error handling

## Success Metrics

### Primary

- Funnels created and published
- Conversion rate (registration → enrollment)
- Platform revenue (2.5% of creator sales)

### Secondary

- Time from signup to first published funnel
- AI generation quality (regeneration rate)
- Creator retention (active funnels)
- Follow-up engagement (open/click rates)

## Strategic Positioning

**We are**: The AI-powered webinar funnel builder for expert creators

**We are not**:

- A general-purpose page builder (too broad)
- A webinar hosting platform (just delivery)
- A full CRM (we integrate with theirs)
- A video platform (we use Cloudflare)
- A payment processor (we use Stripe)

## Long-Term Vision

**Phase 1 (Now)**: Perfect the webinar funnel creation and delivery system

**Phase 2 (6-12 months)**:

- A/B testing for funnel optimization
- Additional funnel types (challenge funnels, mini-course funnels)
- Advanced analytics and recommendations
- White-label options for agencies

**Phase 3 (12-24 months)**:

- AI coaching on funnel performance
- Marketplace for proven funnel templates
- Integration with more platforms (Kajabi, Teachable, etc.)
- International expansion with multi-language support

## What Makes This Work

**AI as Co-Creator**: Not just templates - actual intelligent content generation that
understands marketing frameworks and conversion psychology.

**Opinionated Design**: We don't give creators infinite options. We give them what
converts based on proven patterns.

**Technical Foundation**: Built for scale from day one. Clean architecture,
comprehensive testing, production-grade infrastructure.

**Creator-Centric**: Every decision filtered through "Does this help creators launch
faster and convert better?"
