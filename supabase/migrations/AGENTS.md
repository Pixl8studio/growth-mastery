# Database Migrations

Auto-generated SQL files tracked by Supabase's migration system.

**NEVER manually create or edit migration files.** Generate migrations using:

```bash
supabase db diff -f migration_name
```

Manually created or edited files may appear to work locally but fail silently in
production or cause schema drift. Always generate from schema changes.

After schema changes, regenerate types: `pnpm db:types`
