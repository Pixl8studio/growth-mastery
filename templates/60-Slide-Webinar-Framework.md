| **Connect** | 1-15   | Build trust, share story, create emotional bond    | Trust precedes transaction |

### Key Psychological Principles:

1. **Reciprocity**: Give value first, receive openness to offers
2. **Social Proof**: Show others succeeding to build belief
3. **Authority**: Demonstrate expertise through teaching
4. **Scarcity**: Create urgency through limited bonuses/timing
5. **Liking**: Build connection through authentic story
6. **Commitment**: Small yeses lead to big yeses

### Section Transitions:

- **Connect → Teach**: "Now let me show you exactly how this works..."
- **Teach → Invite**: "You now have the knowledge. Here's how to get the support..."
