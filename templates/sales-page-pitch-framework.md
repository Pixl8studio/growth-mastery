## Sales Page Pitch Video Summary

This framework is designed to work seamlessly with your sales page copy. The video
humanizes your offer, builds trust through personal connection, and reinforces key
messages from the page.

**Psychological Flow:** Welcome (Trust) → Problem (Empathy) → Cost (Urgency) → Solution
(Hope) → Proof (Belief) → Offer (Value) → Risk Reversal (Safety) → CTA (Action)

The goal is to make the sale feel like a natural, helpful next step rather than a pushy
pitch. Your authentic presence on video builds the trust that text alone cannot achieve.

**Video Best Practices:**

- Keep it conversational and natural
- Look directly at camera to create connection
- Use genuine enthusiasm without being over-the-top
- Match energy to your market (B2B vs. B2C)
- Film in high quality with good audio
- Keep total length under 5 minutes if possible

The sales page handles objections and details. Your video handles trust, connection, and
transformation visualization.
