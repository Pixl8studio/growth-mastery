      Issue #109: Test Coverage 1/10: Fix Component Tests - UI & Core

      Fix failing tests in core UI and component modules to establish a stable test foundation.

      ## Tasks
      - Fix 21 tests in `__tests__/unit/components/ui/`
      - Fix 25 tests in `__tests__/unit/components/funnel/`
      - Fix 26 tests in `__tests__/unit/components/marketing/`

      ## Common Issues to Fix
      1. Mock `cn` function from `@/lib/utils` - ensure mock returns className argument
      2. Stub `scrollIntoView` on `Element.prototype` (jsdom limitation)
      3. Handle `hasPointerCapture`/`setPointerCapture` for Radix UI components
      4. Fix async state updates with proper `waitFor()` usage

      ## Verification
      ```bash
      pnpm vitest run __tests__/unit/components/ui/
      pnpm vitest run __tests__/unit/components/funnel/
      pnpm vitest run __tests__/unit/components/marketing/
      ```
